# Niches Ripe For Disruption

A lot of developers (myself included) are always on the lookout for a side project idea, something they can profit off of.

This Github repository is an ongoing list of niches I have identified as being ripe for disruption. This does not mean there is a lack of competitors, it just means I see opportunities for improvement over existing solutions.

The idea behind this repository is to present some niches that entrepreneurs might not necessarily think of when they're looking for that next idea to tackle.

## Childcare Management

Our son goes to daycare one day per week. They offer the ability for parents to login and see how their childs day was, what they ate, how many wet/soiled nappies they had and what they learned. Sounds great in theory, but the particular app our daycare uses is horrendous, the interface is clunky and does not work very well on mobile/tablet devices

After speaking with friends and family who send their kids to childcare/daycare, it seems there are a few of these applications around and every centre seems to be using a different app with similar features. The one thing they have in common after seeing four or so different apps is they all look horrible and they're not very user friendly.

The ideal solution would not only look appealing, but it would have an exceptionally well-thought out user interface.
